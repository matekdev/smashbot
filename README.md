This is a twitter bot that will post a tweet every single time there is a tournament going on for Smash Bros. Melee (for 2018).
It uses the data from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WXWd5yTWVTKQ6S6OXrfYb1WL1DelFSPiiIS_6rWGlGI/edit?ts=5a9f221a#gid=0 in order to determine
which tournaments are going on the given day.
